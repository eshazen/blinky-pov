# Blinky POV

This is a copy of designs from the EDF SVN for Blinky POV (persistence
of vision) toys for soldering training and outreach.

**AVR4** - Version 4 of thru-hole design using an ATTiny44A MCU.
This includes firmware and HTML blinky programming code

**BlinkyColorPOV** - Version using RGB LEDs.  Some issues with
soldering the 4-pin LEDs.  Probably overly-complex for a new project.

See https://github.com/eshazen/blinky-avr-smt for a newer version
based loosely on AVR4.
